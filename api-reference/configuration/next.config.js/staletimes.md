# staleTimes

`staleTimes` is an experimental feature that enables caching of page segments in the client-side router cache.

You can enable this experimental feature and provide custom revalidation times by setting the experimental `staleTimes` flag:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

The `static` and `dynamic` properties correspond with the time period (in seconds) based on different types of link prefetching.

* The `dynamic` property is used when the page is neither statically generated nor fully prefetched (e.g. with `prefetch={true}`).
  * Default: 0 seconds (not cached)
* The `static` property is used for statically generated pages, or when the `prefetch` prop on `Link` is set to `true`, or when calling `router.prefetch`.
  * Default: 5 minutes

> **Good to know:**
>
> * Loading boundaries are considered reusable for the `static` period defined in this configuration.
> * This doesn't affect partial rendering, **meaning shared layouts won't automatically be refetched on every navigation, only the page segment that changes.**
> * This doesn't change back/forward caching behavior to prevent layout shift and to prevent losing the browser scroll position.
